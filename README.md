# Linear-Regression-from-scratch
A Jupyter notebook containing implementation of linear regression on a dummy Kaggle dataset. 
In this notebook, I use two approaches to develop two implementations of Linear Regression, one is by gradient descent and the other is through Ordinary least Squares.
The algorithms are then compared with the Linear Regression algorithm from scikit-learn's library.
